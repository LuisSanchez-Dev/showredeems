## About The Project

Some of us don't have a machine powerful enough to have a Streamlabs Chatbot window open alongside a Chrome window to read the chat and see when someone redeems a reward using Channel Points, that is why this script exists.

No need to have a Chrome window open to read redeems since those will pop right into the Streamlabs Chatbot Console where the chat is.

Thanks to [@Tecno_Diana](https://www.twitch.tv/tecno_diana/) for coming up with the requirement.

## Getting Started

Setting this up so you can use it is super straightforward.

### Prerequisites

Have an installation of Streamlabs Chatbot, already logged in to your accounts.
* [Download Streamlabs Chatbot](https://streamlabs.com/chatbot)

Follow this tutorial to prepare your Streamlabs Chatbot installation to accept scripts.

### Installation

1. Download the latest version of the script [**here**](https://github.com/LuisSanchez-Dev/showredeems/archive/master.zip).
2. If you haven't already, open your Streamlabs Chatbot and log in to your Streamer and Bot accounts.
3. On the left side, wait for the `Scripts` tab to pop up and click it.
4. On the top right corner of the window, next to the reload button is an import script button (Arrow pointing right to a box) and select the script downloaded before.
5. You will receive a message box confirming the import, accept it.
6. The window will update and show the `ShowRedeems` script.
7. Click on the `ShowRedeems` name to see the configuration pane.
